# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template
# Finished Backend and Frontend Setup
 - I set up the Python virtual environment (venv) to manage the project's dependencies.
 - After that, I installed all the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
 - To ensure the backend was working correctly, I started the   server and checked that it was running successfully by visiting http://localhost:8000/medicines in my browser.
 - I also tested the frontend by opening the index.html file in my browser to confirm everything was loading as expected.
